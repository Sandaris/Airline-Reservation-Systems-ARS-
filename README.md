This repository contains my first university coding assignment, which focuses on creating reusable Python modules to streamline the coding process.

**Modules:**

- **`modules/ext_funcs.py`**: Provides commonly used functions designed to smoothen and simplify coding tasks, enhancing code efficiency and reusability.
- **`modules/file_manage.py`**: Offers functionalities similar to those of a database, enabling data management operations within the code.

This project showcases foundational skills in modular programming and effective code organization.
